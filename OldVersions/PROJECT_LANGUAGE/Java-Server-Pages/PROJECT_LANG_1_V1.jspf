* I decided to make Java Server Pages the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Java-Server-Pages) as Java Server Pages is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Java Server Pages programming language. It only makes sense to Java Server Pages the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
